            <p>Why I love web desing? <br>  The ability to create amazing products is the number one reason why I love web design. Being a Web designer enables me to not only work with websites every day but also to shape the way people interact with the Web.
               It also helps that I have the freedom to be creative and work with great people.</p>

            <h1 class="headings">Photography</h1>
            <p>Why I love photography? <br>It keeps me excited and allows me to freeze a moment in time within an image, which you can enjoy forever. I appreciate the raw reality of everyday life, the fleeting beauty of those inbetween moments and I do my best to take every picture with that in mind. <br>As a photographer, I own creativity, patience and concentration, attention to detail, strong networking skills. I provide a custom photographic experience that captures those keepsake memories.</p>
